# CHIP-8 Emulator in C++

A simple **CHIP-8 emulator** written in C++, capable of running classic CHIP-8 programs and games. This project is primarily for learning purposes and exploring emulation, low-level system design, and game programming.

---

## Features

- Implements the full CHIP-8 instruction set.
- Supports 64x32 pixel monochrome display.
- Handles keyboard input (hex-based keys 0x0–0xF).
- Timers for delay and sound.
- Loads and executes CHIP-8 ROM files.
- Simple debugging output to monitor memory, registers, and opcode execution.

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- SDL2 (optional, for graphical output and input handling).
- CMake (optional, for building the project).
